wordcount
=========

This project aims to provide word count programs in different languages, being as neat as possible.

Given a directory, the program is to count the number of occurences of each word that ever
occurs in text files in that directory, recursively.

The objective is simplicity rather than efficiency or robustness. Issues like delimiter rule and
error handling can be ignored.

Typically, an implementation demonstrates the control flow, subroutines and built-in libraries of the language, thus can be regarded as a strengthened "hello world".

Expected result:

::

      2 brown
      2 dog
      2 fox
      1 hello
      2 jumps
      2 lazy
      2 over
      2 quick
      4 the
      1 world
