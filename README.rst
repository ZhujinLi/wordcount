wordcount
=========

The project aims to provide word count programs in different languages, being as neat as possible.

Given a directory, the program is to count the frequency (number of occurences) of each word that ever
occurs in text files in that directory, recursively.

The objective is simplicity rather than efficiency or robustness. Issues like delimiters and
error handling can just be ignored.

Typically, an implementation demonstrates the control flow, subroutines, built-in data structures and I/O operations of the language, thus can be regarded as a strengthened "hello world".
