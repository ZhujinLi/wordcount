wordcount
=========

The project aims to provide word count programs in different languages, as neat as possible.

Given a directory, the program is to count the frequency (number of occurences) of each word that ever
occurs in text files in that directory, recursively.

The objective is simplicity rather than efficiency or robustness. Issues like case-sensitivity and
ranking can just be ignored.
